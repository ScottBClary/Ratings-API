# Ratings-API


Create a db called SDC_Ratings


To create database, manually copy+paste each command from loadReviews.sql. This sql file is not supposed to actually be ran, it is just a holder for commands.
npm run db will !!!delete current tables!!! and then create a new one with schemas
npm run server-dev will start the server.
